# Getting started

- This library uses Windows code and requires VS 2019 v16.11.2 or better.
- On Windows with VisualStudio, use the Nuget package! 
- Make sure you use `c++latest` as the `<format>` is no longer in the `c++20` option pending ABI resolution.

> **NOTE**
> We are going to track VS 2022 and make full use of C++20 facilities and the API is subject to change.
